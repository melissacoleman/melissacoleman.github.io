This electronic lace collar uses digital fashion to raise awareness. Similar to ribbons or charity wristbands, it uses a simple message -one white light- to visualise the loss of a human life. It honours the women who die before the age of 18 while giving birth.

Unicef reports that every 7.5 minutes a girl is the victim of a combination of preventable circumstances: lack of education, marriage and pregnancy before adulthood along with poor healthcare. For each preventable death, the lace lights up once, and then fades away.
